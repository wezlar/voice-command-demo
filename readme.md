# Iris

Welcome to the in progress build of Iris. An AI which can complete tasks via speech and text commands. 

Hopefully, you'll be able to have a full conversation with Iris, which can be personalised to work with a variety of external sources.

## Current ability

At this moment, this is just proof of concept. You can start the script in a chrome web browser, or anything else which supports the Speech Systhesis API. 

The only command it recognises is 'Iris', which will give you a different response, but end the converstation.

## Getting started

Clone the repo somewhere and then run `npm install`.

To run the demo, enter the following command which should open a web browser and the demo page.

```
npm run dev
```

## Future development

There are a couple of technologies that I have planned to incorporate into this project. As with each, there are various different types in which we can use. As I review them and finally settle on each, they will appear in the list below.
